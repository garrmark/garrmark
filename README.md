## 🙋‍♂️ About me

![profile view count](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=garrmark)

An experienced, hands-on, technical leader dedicated to fostering collaborative teams that develop cutting-edge solutions 💻. With a focus on maximizing functionality and user-friendliness, while ensuring robust performance and system stability. Driven by a passion for innovation and enabling team success.

When I'm not creating release pipelines or building SaaS offerings, I can be found road or mountain biking 🚴, hiking 🚶, skiing ⛷️, thowing something on the smoker 🔥, and spending time with my beautiful wife Geniene ❤️.
